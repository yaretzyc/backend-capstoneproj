# Backend Capstone Project for Book Club application

<p>I enjoy reading ðŸ“– and discussing with others book related topics. With the pandemic I though maybe this application can be for other introverts as well who also enjoy reading with a cup of coffee â˜• and posting book quotes and reviews. This repo contains the backend Java Springboot backend API that communicates with <a href="https://github.com/yaretzyc/frontend-capstoneproject">Fontend Angular application/a>.</p>
